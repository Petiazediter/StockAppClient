# Stock App Client

Unfortunately ran out of time so only includes the MVP features.
Because of the API limitations, sometimes the app will just use mocked data. A console warning will pop-up to indicate if this is happening.

## Run the application

1) Run it locally
2) Visit the deployed version

#### Localhost

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Visit the deployed version on vercel
